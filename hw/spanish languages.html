    <p>
 <strong>Spanish</strong> sometimes called <em>Castilian</em>, is the only official language of the entire country <br>
         and is spoken habitually and as a native language among a vast majority of the Spanish population. <br>
         It is also co-official with other languages in <em>Catalonia, Balearic Islands, Valencia, Galicia, Basque Country</em> and <em>the Basque zone of Navarre</em>. <br>
         In all of the bilingual autonomous communities, with the exception of <em>Galicia</em>, <br>
         Spanish is actually the native language of the majority of the population, <br>
         although this is due in large part to the internal migration processes that occurred in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a> from the middle of the 20th century.
